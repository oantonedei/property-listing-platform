# MWA-Final-Project-January-2023
### Final Project
### Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Take your time to plan your project idea, write down a short description for it, set your goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* Use at least one featured lazy-loaded module in the frontend and proper REST design in the backend.
* Projects must have proper UI complies with the web standards.
  
Note: Chat and e-commerce/cart applications are not allowed. Set a more challenging goal.
  
### Technical information
* You must use all the technologies we learned in our course (MEAN stack).
* Design your own NoSQL DB schemas and app structure (let me know if you need help with this). Start by planning your screens. (use DB as a service – Atlas).
* All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* A daily push is required to track your code and performance. If you miss a push that will affect your final grade.
* Do not push any private key of any service to Git. (If found, your account will be terminated and you may be legally sued by service providers). Write your keys in a config file (npm i dotenv) and add the filename to .gitignore
* Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
  
### Notes and daily routine
You are free to work from any comfortable spot you may choose and are not required to come or to be in the classroom. I'm available to assist you any day through Teams from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, including the weekend. The classroom will be open and available all days.
    
### Final Evaluation
The last push should be performed before Tuesday 9 pm. I will meet online with every team individually on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and evaluate the final project code. 
  
It is required from every team lead to send me a report to asaad@miu.edu on Tuesday before 9 pm with the following details:
* A summary of the project idea.
* A list of all problems/solutions/new things you learned during the project. 
* Your daily schedule, including the daily tasks assigned to each team member.
* Copy/paste your config file (all secret keys) and include that in the email.
    
Good luck and happy coding!
  
Groups should not work with each other or share or copy code from any source. Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as one’s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
